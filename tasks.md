# Plans
E is the interact key. It is context sensitive:
- When over a tree, it harvests wood
- When over a bush, it harvests berries
- When over a wall you constructed, it repairs it
- When over a piece of wood, it picks it up
- When over a fire, picks up an ember

5,6,7 Eat the different types of berries
1 - Drops a piece of wood
2 - Constructs a wall
3 - Constructs a ceiling
4 - Starts a fire (if you have an ember)

## Storms
During storms, the wind shears in random directions. If there's a path from the outside to the PC, your temperature drops. The wind is stronger higher up.

## Lightning
If nothing on the island is on fire, a random flammable object will be struck by lightning.

## Resuce
If you have a fire burning at the highest point, and a plane is flying by, you are rescued and win.
